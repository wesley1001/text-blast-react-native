# Text Blast - React Native

### Project

This project is a cross-platform mobile app allowing users to blast their friends with purchasable packs of MMS messages.

### Structure

This is a react-native mobile client that talks to a nodejs [backend](https://github.com/SeshApp/text-blast).

*There is an analogous [ionic mobile client](https://github.com/SeshApp/text-blast-ionic) for directly comparing Ionic and React Native on a simple, real-world app.*

### Todo

* order processing screen
* push notifications to notify sender of each message sent
* orders section which lists past orders and their status

* add category search
* fix category-list issue where loading and isRefreshing can both be true
* cache categories and top-level images in-app

* https://github.com/akiran/react-slick
* lightbox message previews (react-native-lightbox)
* fix some of the quirks with giftedform
