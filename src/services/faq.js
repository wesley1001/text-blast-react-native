    q: "What is this?!",
    a: "Text Blast is a service which lets you bombard your friends with GIFs, images, and text MMS messages."
  },
  {
    q: "What countries and numbers are supported?",
    a: "All countries and numbers are supported via Twilio, though for non US &amp; Canadian (+1) numbers, you must supply the corresponding country code prefix."
  },
  {
    q: "Can a recipient stop the message blast?",
    a: "Yes, you may opt out of receiving further texts by responding STOP to any incoming message. We use Twilio to send all texts, and Twilio supports industry standard SMS STOP filtering."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I pay? Is it secure?",
    a: "We use industry standard in-app purchases to handle payments. Note that aside from this app, our site (textblast.io) accepts VISA, Mastercard, and American Express card payments, which are processed securely by Stripe over SSL."
  },
  {
    q: "What information do you store?",
    a: "We store your name and the recipient's number while an order is active. Once an order is complete or aborts because of too many MMS failures, it is permanently deleted from our database. \n\nWe promise never to sell or distribute any phone numbers obtained through the Text Blast service. Additionally, Stripe allows us to securely process payments without our backend ever encountering or storing payment info. For more details, please refer to our legal section."

    q: "Want to see a different category?",

  },
  {
    q: "Where did the idea for Text Blast come from?",
    a: "We were inspired by a handful of similar sites that launched recently, notably Goat Attack, Cat Attack, Pug a Day, and Corgi Splash. Text Blast differentiates itself from these other options by allowing people to choose from a wide variety of categories and focusing on more engaging GIF content."
